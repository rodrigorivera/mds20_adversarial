# mds20_adversarial
This is the repository for the Models of Sequence Data 2020 Edition for the project Generating Natural Language Adversarial Examples on a Large Scale with Generative Models. 

## Structure of the project:
- TBD

## TODO: 
- Implement the paper. 
- Modify the existing architecture to be able to generate adversarial examples without fine-tuning.

## Installation and running:
- TBD

## Requirements:
- TBD

## Existing implementation:
- Provided by authors of paper using `AlienNLP` framework. We were unable to test it yet. 
- Assumes to use `Docker` for running 

## Ideas on the implementation: (by Daniil)
- Models used in the project need to be trained separately as the proposed approach uses pretrained model. All models are going to be available in the specific folder `models`
- Datasets used in the paper are available at PyTorch
- Specific functions will be stored separately at folder `utils`
- Examples of usage and experiments will be done in Jupyter Notebooks and will be stored at folder `examples`
